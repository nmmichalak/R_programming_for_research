# example: generate descriptive statistics
> - **C3T3.** "Although different mood states have, of course, always been of interest to clinicians, recent years have seen a profusion of studies attempting to manipulate mood states in controlled laboratory studies. In such induced-mood research, participants typically are **randomly assigned to one of three groups: a depressed-mood induction, a neutral-mood induction, or an elated-mood induction.** One study (Pruitt, 1988) used selected videoslips from several movies and public television programs as the mood-induction treatments. After viewing the video for her assigned condition, each participant was asked to indicate her mood on various scales. In addition, each subject was herself **videotaped, and her facial expressions of emotion were rated on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 indicating sad; 4, neutral; and 7, happy) by an assistant** who viewed the videotapes but was kept "blind" regarding the subjects' assigned conditions."

When asking “why” does not hurt: Distinguishing rumination from reflective processing of negative emotions. Psychological Science, 16, 709–715. One hundred fifty-five undergraduate students were asked to “recall an interpersonal experience in which they felt overwhelming anger and hostility,” and were **randomly assigned to one of four conditions instructing them to adopt a perspective combining a type of self-perspective (self-immersed vs. self-distanced) and type of emotional focus (what vs. why).** In the self-immersed perspective, participants were told to “relive the situation as if it were happening to you all over again,” whereas in the self-distanced perspective they were to move away from their experience and watch it unfold from a distance. Participants were to focus on either the specific feelings they were experiencing (what focus) or on the reasons underlying their feelings (why focus). **The dependent variable was a measure of implicit anger, namely, how many of seven target word fragments were completed as anger (e.g., rage, hate) rather than neutral words.** The investigators treated this as a one-way design with four groups."
