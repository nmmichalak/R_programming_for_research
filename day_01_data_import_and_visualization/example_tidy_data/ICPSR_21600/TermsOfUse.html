In preparing these data for public release, Add Health and ICPSR performed a number of procedures to ensure that the identity of research subjects, households, schools and communities cannot be disclosed. For example, direct identifiers were omitted from datasets, and some characteristics were recoded or masked if they could be combined with others to identify individuals. Any intentional or unintentional identification or disclosure of a person, household, school, organization, or community violates the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the information. Therefore, users of Add Health data obtained from the ICPSR archive and/or any of its special topic archives agree:</p> <ul> <li><p>To use these datasets solely for research and aggregate statistical reporting and/or educational use in classrooms, and not for investigation of specific individuals, households, schools, organizations, or communities </p></li> <li><p>To avoid the release of any information that could identify individuals, households, schools, or communities, either directly or indirectly</p></li> <li><p>To avoid inadvertent disclosure of persons, families, or households by using the following guidelines in the release of statistics derived from the data files:</p> <ol> <li><p>In no table should all cases in any row or column be found in a single cell</p></li> <li><p>In no instance should the total for a row or column of a cross-tabulation be fewer than three (3)</p></li> <li><p>In no case should a cell frequency of a cross-tabulation be fewer than three (3) cases</p></li> <li><p>In no instance should a quantity figure be based on fewer than three (3) cases</p></li> <li><p>Data released should never permit disclosure when used in combination with other known data</p></li> </ol> </li> <li><p>To make no use of the identity of any person, household, school, organization, or community discovered inadvertently; to advise ICPSR and Add Health of any such discovery within one (1) business day; and to safeguard or destroy the identifying information as requested by ICPSR and Add Health</p></li> <li><p>To produce no links among ICPSR datasets or among ICPSR data and other datasets that could identify individuals, households, schools, organizations, or communities</p></li> <li><p>To comply with the requirement that downloaded material not be redistributed or sold to any person who is not affiliated with your institution; and to notify ICPSR and Add Health of any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of the data within one (1) business day of the incident</p></li> <li><p>To require others at your institution who use the data to read this agreement</p></li> <li><p>To include the following acknowledgement in any books, articles, conference papers, theses, dissertations, reports or other publications that employ Add Health data: </p> <p>This research uses data from Add Health, a program project designed by J. Richard Udry, Peter S. Bearman, and Kathleen Mullan Harris, and funded by a grant P01-HD31921 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, with cooperative funding from 17 other agencies.
