# Example: Generate descriptive statistics.
> - **C3T3.** "Although different mood states have, of course, always been of interest to clinicians, recent years have seen a profusion of studies attempting to manipulate mood states in controlled laboratory studies. In such induced-mood research, participants typically are **randomly assigned to one of three groups: a depressed-mood induction, a neutral-mood induction, or an elated-mood induction.** One study (Pruitt, 1988) used selected videoslips from several movies and public television programs as the mood-induction treatments. After viewing the video for her assigned condition, each participant was asked to indicate her mood on various scales. In addition, each subject was herself **videotaped, and her facial expressions of emotion were rated on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 indicating sad; 4, neutral; and 7, happy) by an assistant** who viewed the videotapes but was kept "blind" regarding the subjects' assigned conditions."

As usual, in this data set, the number of subjects is kept small to minimize the computational burden. We assume that the scores in the table represent systolic blood pressure readings taken at the end of the treatment period.  
> The following data consists specifically of blood pressure measurements taken after the end of treatment for five individuals that were randomly assigned to one of four groups. The initial question of interest is whether there is a significant difference between any of the group means, that is, are all of the population group means equal or is there a difference somewhere."

# Exercise: Play with the `C3E19` dataset from `AMCP`
> - **C3E19.** "Psychologists have investigated under what conditions recalling negative emotions can be helpful as opposed to harmful. The current problem asks you to analyze data like that reported by Kross, E., Ayduk, O., & Mischel, W. (2005). When asking “why” does not hurt: Distinguishing rumination from reflective processing of negative emotions. Psychological Science, 16, 709–715. One hundred fifty-five undergraduate students were asked to “recall an interpersonal experience in which they felt overwhelming anger and hostility,” and were **randomly assigned to one of four conditions instructing them to adopt a perspective combining a type of self-perspective (self-immersed vs. self-distanced) and type of emotional focus (what vs. why).** In the self-immersed perspective, participants were told to “relive the situation as if it were happening to you all over again,” whereas in the self-distanced perspective they were to move away from their experience and watch it unfold from a distance. Participants were to focus on either the specific feelings they were experiencing (what focus) or on the reasons underlying their feelings (why focus). **The dependent variable was a measure of implicit anger, namely, how many of seven target word fragments were completed as anger (e.g., rage, hate) rather than neutral words.** The investigators treated this as a one-way design with four groups."

# How do I test correlations?
> - `corr.test()`: "Although the cor function finds the correlations for a matrix, it does not report probability values. cor.test does, but for only one pair of variables at a time. corr.test uses cor to find the correlations for either complete or pairwise data and reports the sample sizes and probability values as well. For symmetric matrices, raw probabilites are reported below the diagonal and correlations adjusted for multiple comparisons above the diagonal. In the case of different x and ys, the default is to adjust the probabilities for multiple tests. Both corr.test and corr.p return raw and adjusted confidence intervals for each correlation."

>     + lme4 includes generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) capabilities, via the glmer function.
>     + `lme4` does not currently implement nlme's features for modeling heteroscedasticity and correlation of residuals.
>     + `lme4` does not currently offer the same flexibility as nlme for composing complex variance-covariance structures, but it does implement crossed random effects in a way that is both easier for the user and much faster.
>     + `lme4` offers built-in facilities for likelihood profiling and parametric bootstrapping.
>     + `lme4` is designed to be more modular than nlme, making it easier for downstream package developers and end-users to re-use its components for extensions of the basic mixed model framework.

# Why we don't want to recommend factors ...
> - **factor type.** "A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data. Factors are built on top of integer vectors using two attributes: the class, “factor”, which makes them behave differently from regular integer vectors, and the levels, which defines the set of allowed values."
> - `factor(levels, labels)`: "factor returns an object of class "factor" which has a set of integer codes the length of x with a "levels" attribute of mode character and unique (!anyDuplicated(.)) entries."
>     + **levels.** "an optional vector of the unique values (as character strings) that x might have taken. The default is the unique set of values taken by as.character(x), sorted into increasing order of x."
>     + **labels.** "either an optional character vector of labels for the levels (in the same order as levels after removing those in exclude), or a character string of length 1."

## Why we don't want to recommend factors ...
> From [Rich Gonzalez, p. 32](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gonzo/coursenotes/file8.pdf): "The entry in the first row/fourth column is 0 but it should be a 1 to code the correct interaction term. The mathematics of regression are such that the total R2 for the full model (all three predictors) will be correct if you enter these three predictors, but the test of the main effects will be wrong because the resulting codes are not the ones intended by the researcher. One needs to be very careful when using dummy coding. Because of their simplicity dummy codes are the most frequently used codes in regression and **it makes me wonder how many incorrect main effects are reported in the literature.**"
