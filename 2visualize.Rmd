# Install and/or load packages for this session
> - `install.packages()`: "Download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from local files."  
> - `library()`: loads your package you installed  
> - **Best Practice Note.** `install.packages()` downloads files from the internet, so it's "polite" to "comment out" (`#` = comment) this code before you share it with people so they don't download files they don't really want by accident.

# How do I answer research questions with plots?
> - **Use `ggplot2`.**
> - **`ggplot2` metaphor.** Think of a `ggplot2` plot like a "map of the world" that you build one layer at a time.
> - Imagine a map of the world without land (i.e., water only).
> - Now imagine adding "layers" (e.g., continents, colors, mountains, legends). `ggplot2`'s kinda like that.

# How do I answer research questions with plots?
> - With `ggplot2`, you build plots step-by-step, layer-by-layer. this system is based on the grammar of graphics: statistical graphics map **data** onto *perceivable* **aesthetic attributes** (e.g., position, color, shape, size, line type) of **geometric objects** (e.g., points, bars, lines).

# Example: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
> 1. Start with mapping and `aes()`
>   - **displ.** Engine displacement, in litres (bigger numbers = greater engine size)
